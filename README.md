# basic-mathmatics-for-machine-learning
I'd like to systematically share my summary learning notes of some mathmatic knowledge used in machine learning. It would be easier to understand my notes if you learned basic calculus and linear algebra before. I will update the repository irregularly because I have much assignments to do.
